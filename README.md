# Chitter: a Twitter clone
TODO: Write a project description

This was onriginally a weekend challenge set by our coaches at Makers Academy. I was not happy with what I produced the first time around so I added 'complete the chitter challnge + extend it' to my coding bucket list (you can check out my first attempt here[link to my original chitter repo]). This is the challenge set to us [link to makers github]
